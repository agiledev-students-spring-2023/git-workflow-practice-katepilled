## [Why Metaâ€™s Yann LeCun Is An AI GodFather And Why ChatGPT3 Is Not Revolutionary.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cindygordon/2023/01/27/why-yann-lecun-is-an-ai-godfather-and-why-chatgpt3-is-not-revolutionary/?ss=ai&sh=3b57f57d7a64)

I was primarily drawn to this article because its focus on ChatGPT and Yann LeCun. ChatGPT has all the buzz right now, so this article's headline drew me in. On a more personal note, I got to take a 2 credit AI-centered elective led by Professor LeCun, so I was interested to read an article focused on him and his thoughts on ChatGPT. His take on the current state of AI was incredibly interesting, and I thought it was interesting that his views on AI haven't changed much from the time I took his class to now, with ChatGPT's release. 

I particularly liked LeCun's comparison of AI to a cat, where claimed that a cat is "much smarter than AI -- as a cat is all sensing." I thought this was a really refreshing take on the subject, and something I haven't really thought of prior to reading the article. But reading it, I agree with LeCun and the author; I think there is a vast difference between behaviors based on sensory detection and behaviors based on historical data patterns. While what's happening right now with AI is exciting, it's also incredibly new. It was interesting to hear LeCun's take on ChatGPT and AI as a whole, with him being someone who is so well-versed in the subject.
